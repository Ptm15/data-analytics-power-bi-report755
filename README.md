# Data Analytics in Power BI Report

This repository contains a Power BI project aimed at providing actionable insights for informed decision-making through data analytics. The project involves importing and transforming data from various sources to create visualisations and reports.

## Overview

The project utilises Power BI to analyse and visualise data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on insights derived from the data. The report covers multiple aspects of a business operation, including sales, product performance, customer behaviour, and geographical analysis.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 & 2: Setting up Development Environment

For Mac or Linux user without native access to Power BI, follow these steps to set up a Windows Virtual Machine (VM) on Azure:

- **Provision a Windows VM:** Provision a Windows VM (size D2s_v3) on Azure, utilising the Â£200 free credit from the Azure free trial.
- **Connect to Azure VM:** Connect to the Azure VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
- **Install Power BI Desktop:** Download and install Power BI Desktop for Windows from the official Microsoft website.
- **Transform Data:** Connect to the Azure database and transform tables using Power BI Query Editor.

### Milestone 3: Establishing Data Model

Created relationships between tables to form a star schema model, ensuring correct settings and activating relationships as necessary. Additionally, created a separate table named "Measures Table" in the data model view using Power Query Editor.

### Milestone 10: Creating Metrics for External Users

Connect to the Azure database via SQL in Visual Studio Code to query the database and create metrics for users outside the company.

Answered 5 questions from project milsetone using SQL querys

Examples:

```sql
-- How many staff are there in all of the UK stores? 

SELECT SUM(staff_numbers) AS total_staff_uk
FROM dim_store
WHERE country_code = 'GB';
```
```sql
-- Which German store type had the highest revenue for 2022? 

SELECT store_type AS german_store_type,
       SUM(sale_price) AS total_revenue
FROM forquerying2
WHERE country = 'Germany'  
      AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM dates::timestamp) = 2022  
GROUP BY store_type
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;

```
